# Scopus_Author_Publications_Search
The code is written to find out the work of a researcher in tabular form if the Scopus ID is known. You can filter the search for months/years and or use multiple Scopus IDs. Make sure to have a Scopus API key for the use. Also, the code expects Excel file with the author name and Scopus ID in the Excel sheet as input.
